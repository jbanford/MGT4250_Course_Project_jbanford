### Questions of Interest 
1. What are the dominant music genres over the past 10 years, and how do they compare in terms of popularity and market share?
2. How does the popularity of music genres vary across different states in the America, and what regional patterns or trends emerge?
3. How have the proportions of the top 10 music genres changed over the past decade, and what insights can be drawn from these temporal trends?
## Data Description 
1. First reason
2. Second reason
3. I focused on the columns year and genre. Year is an integer in the data and genre is a type object. The genre column allows us to identify and analyze unique values and we use year to filter by specific year from 2012-2022.
## Interpreting Visualizations
1. The treemap visualization illustrates the dominance of specific music genres over the past decade, highlighting their relative market share and popularity. The larger rectangles represent genres with a higher share, offering a visual snapshot of the industry's landscape. Understanding these dominant genres provides valuable insights into the evolving preferences of music consumers. This information is crucial for artists, producers, and record labels to make informed decisions about the type of music to create, invest in, and promote. It also helps streaming platforms tailor their recommendations which improves user engagement and satisfaction.
2. The choropleth map visually displays the geographical distribution of music genre preferences across states. Variances in color indicate the prevelance of the top genres listed. Understanding regional variations in music preferences is critical for tailoring marketing and promotional strategies to specific demographics. Artists and management labels can use this information to optimize concert tours, target promotional campaigns, and develop a resonance with local markets. Such a visualization exposes the cultural diversity within the music industry, fostering a deeper appreciation for different genres in various parts of the nations cultural landscape.
3. The pie chart, with its temporal filter, provides a dynamic view of how the popularity of different genres has evolved over the years. Changes in slice sizes reflect shifting trends which is essential for identifying emerging patterns, cultural shifts, and cyclical trends. This information is invaluable for stakeholders in the music industry to anticipate future market trends, make strategic decisions on artist signings and promotions, and adapt their business models to stay relevant in such a dynamic and ever-evolving market.
